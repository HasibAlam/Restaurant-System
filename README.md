# Restaurant-System

Designed and developed a full-stack restaurant management system using React for the frontend and MySQL for the backend. The system streamlined operations such as reservation management, order processing, and real-time kitchen communication, ensuring seamless interaction between front-of-house staff and the kitchen. Implemented automated invoicing and secure payment processing supporting cash and card transactions. The system was built with scalability in mind, incorporating object-oriented design principles and utilizing design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, and MVC to allow for future feature expansion and efficient handling of increased loads. Additionally, the system provided data analytics features to generate sales reports and track customer behavior, helping optimize restaurant operations.
